# me193e-292e: Next Generation Data Centers and Energy Management Systems
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for ME193E/292E! This repository serves as the central hub for all course materials, including lecture slides, example code, and project specifications.

## Current Course Instance: **Spring 2026 (Sp26)**
All active students should primarily navigate to the following directory for time-sensitive materials like slides and projects: `./course_instances/Sp26/`

### Key Content for Sp26:
* Lecture Slides: Found under `./course_instances/Sp26/lectures/`.
* Project Assignments: Found under `./course_instances/Sp26/projects/`.

## Universal Learning Resources
These materials are continuously refined and form the core pedagogical content of the course. They are *not* specific to any single semester.

### 1. Jupyter Notebooks (Modeling and Analysis)
Use these notebooks to explore fundamental concepts, data analysis, and energy system modeling.

* Location: `./universal/jupyter_notebooks/`
* How to Run: We recommend using a virtual environment or a service like Google Colab/Jupyter Hub for seamless execution.

### 2. Coding Fundamentals
Basic examples and syntax reminders for running Fortran code, which we use for high-performance simulation.

* Location: `./universal/fortran_basics/`
* Tooling: Ensure you have a Fortran compiler installed (e.g., `gfortran`). You can compile these files using the command: `gfortran filename.f90 -o output_name && ./output_name`

## Usage and Contributing
This repository is maintained by the course instructor Prof. Thomas Schutzius and Ben Brown.

### For Students:
* Do Not Fork: Please **do not fork** this repository to submit homework or projects. Submissions should follow the guidelines specified in the course syllabus or learning management system (e.g., Canvas, Moodle).
* Report Issues: If you find an error (typo in a slide, bug in an example snippet), please open a **GitHub Issue** detailing the problem. This is the fastest way to get corrections implemented.

### For Instructors (Future Semesters):
* To create a new course instance (e.g., Fall 2026), copy the structure from the latest offering into a new folder:
    `./course_instances/Fa26/`
* Universal content should be updated directly in the `./universal/` directory.
